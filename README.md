# My-Work

I am a data lover and love the way machine learning is changing human lives. I was always fascinated by the fact that how do we think and take decisions and this field is letting me understand about the same and not only understand but also to make machines process the data as we humans do. 
But while learning this art I came to this conclusion that alone machines can utilize the data that is fed into as yet we have not reached upto that level where we would be able to transfer our intuition capabilities to machines. So as of now the best we can get out of this is by handholding/guiding machines to learn from the data.

So while learning and understanding this technology I have implemented it on various datasets to understand how it behaves and how to tune it. I have not tried to improve the models' predictive ability on datasets and understood what works on what and how.
This repo also works well as my personal notes.

Thank you!
